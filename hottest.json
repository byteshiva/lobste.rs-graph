Before that, I studied philosophy.\r\n\r\nOn the philosophy side, I'm chiefly interested in metaphysics (ontology and mathematics/formal systems \u0026 semantics) and deontological ethics (praise and blame, moral education, honesty \u0026 bad faith).\r\n\r\nOn the computational side, I'm chiefly interested in program analysis, security, and systems programming. I do a decent amount of professional open source work on projects that encompass some of those.\r\n\r\nMy opinions are my own and do not reflect those of any employer, institutions, affiliates, lovers or haters past, present, or future. They might also not even be mine anymore!\r\n\r\nSites: yossarian.net / blog.yossarian.net / twitter.com/8x5clPW2","is_moderator":false,"karma":1001,"avatar_url":"/avatars/yossarian-100.png","invited_by_user":"trent","github_username":"woodruffw","keybase_signatures":[{"kb_username":"yossarian","sig_hash":"4fd3ae5c9de3d431a6081661b7db925f39596750774fac6a98a36ad05ef272810f"}]},"user_is_author":true,"tags":["rust","security"]},{"short_id":"swa7yd","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/swa7yd","created_at":"2023-11-20T02:46:30.000-06:00","title":"GraphCast: AI model for faster and more accurate global weather forecasting","url":"https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/graphcast-ai-model-for-faster-and-more-accurate-global-weather-forecasting/","score":5,"flags":0,"comment_count":0,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/swa7yd/graphcast_ai_model_for_faster_more","submitter_user":{"username":"adamshaylor","created_at":"2020-10-26T20:04:57.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":2874,"avatar_url":"/avatars/adamshaylor-100.png","invited_by_user":"peterc","github_username":"adamshaylor","keybase_signatures":[{"kb_username":"adamshaylor","sig_hash":"0ebd1a3d88d97f20922147a75889dfcae02b632d94156b9315a6d93384ae2e4f0f"}]},"user_is_author":false,"tags":["ai","release","science"]},{"short_id":"clfulh","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/clfulh","created_at":"2023-11-19T05:11:02.000-06:00","title":"The Big TDD Misunderstanding (2022)","url":"https://linkedrecords.com/the-big-tdd-misunderstanding-8e22c2f1fc21","score":27,"flags":0,"comment_count":13,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/clfulh/big_tdd_misunderstanding_2022","submitter_user":{"username":"lu","created_at":"2019-02-24T08:01:30.000-06:00","is_admin":false,"about":"France.","is_moderator":false,"karma":1226,"avatar_url":"/avatars/lu-100.png","invited_by_user":"gerikson","github_username":"enzzc"},"user_is_author":false,"tags":["practices","testing"]},{"short_id":"naidix","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/naidix","created_at":"2023-11-19T07:25:58.000-06:00","title":"Put some CLOS in your ECS","url":"https://edoput.it/2023/11/19/data-oriented-clos.html","score":10,"flags":0,"comment_count":6,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/naidix/put_some_clos_your_ecs","submitter_user":{"username":"edoput","created_at":"2018-04-12T07:03:13.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Learning how to do things with others.\r\nProgramming and proving at UTwente.\r\n\r\nFind me on #lobsters\r\n\r\n[github](https://github.com/edoput)\r\n[blog](http://www.edoput.it)","is_moderator":false,"karma":527,"avatar_url":"/avatars/edoput-100.png","invited_by_user":"GeoffWozniak"},"user_is_author":true,"tags":["lisp"]},{"short_id":"wm2jre","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/wm2jre","created_at":"2023-11-19T05:10:28.000-06:00","title":"Safety features of the Hare programming language (2022)","url":"https://harelang.org/blog/2022-06-21-safety-features/","score":13,"flags":0,"comment_count":12,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/wm2jre/safety_features_hare_programming","submitter_user":{"username":"kuijsten","created_at":"2018-09-06T05:56:47.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"","is_moderator":false,"karma":903,"avatar_url":"/avatars/kuijsten-100.png","invited_by_user":"taal","github_username":"timkuijsten"},"user_is_author":false,"tags":["plt","security"]},{"short_id":"0bgrev","short_id_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/0bgrev","created_at":"2023-11-19T04:14:41.000-06:00","title":"A simple ray tracer written in the meson.build language","url":"https://github.com/annacrombie/meson-raytracer","score":22,"flags":0,"comment_count":3,"description":"","description_plain":"","comments_url":"https://lobste.rs/s/0bgrev/simple_ray_tracer_written_meson_build","submitter_user":{"username":"meithecatte","created_at":"2021-05-06T06:49:21.000-05:00","is_admin":false,"about":"Striving to learn as much as possible in Math ∪ Computer Science ∖ Machine Learning, with strong tendencies towards proof assistants, automated reasoning, compilers, programming language theory, software bootstrapping, abstract algebra, cryptography, and security.\r\n\r\nPlaying CTF at p4.team every now and then.","is_moderator":false,"karma":845,"avatar_url":"/avatars/meithecatte-100.png","invited_by_user":"jix","keybase_signatures":[{"kb_username":"niedzejkob","sig_hash":"b0430d6a6e06124e80a3fadf619f22345584426c7baa4b557f01d6a79331d9340f"}]},"user_is_author":false,"tags":["assembly","graphics","plt"]}]
